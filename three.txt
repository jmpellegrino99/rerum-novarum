My classmates call me a loser
'Cause I'm still working this job
I've been a BigQuery user
For so many years that it's making me sob

You said that I'm a good analyst
An employee you couldn't lose
But now your words are my catalyst
For going to LinkedIn just to peruse

You said I only earned a 3
But you're . . .

Using my work at CLT and showing it to Umesh
Am I a 3 now?
Showing me off to CADP as one of your best
Am I a 3 now?
I know what you tell Vikas
That I'm a 3 -- If I'm a 3 now, then
Maybe I should just get lost
If I'm a 3, then I'm a 3 now
