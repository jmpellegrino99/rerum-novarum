Jack:

I doubt very much that there are many on our team, or in our organization more broadly, who are as eager to ascend the corporate ladder than Jack Anderson. His commitment to his work, and his demonstrated ferocity in the pursuit of excellence, is unquestionable. He is possessed of a work ethic that I have scarcely seen in my professional career to date. He is unquestionably qualified for promotion and for all the benefits attendant thereto.

I have worked with Jack in 2024 only directly on the KPC project being run by Peter Song. I joined the project in an advisory role, of sorts, while wrapping up loose ends on the branch closure project. At that time, Jack was, and continues to be, the lead architect on all things data. Leveraging some past work, but not much, Jack built a multi-thousand-line compendium of SQL scripts that assembled the beginnings of the KPC SPR (standardized performance review). Using confusing, disparate, and at times internally contradictory data elements, Jack established an impressive dataset that informed our initial diagnostic of KPC program performance over the two years since it was launched.

When I joined Jack in these data endeavors, I was impressed by his ability to keep many moving parts aligned. The zeal Jack exhibits for his work was made most manifest in all the times he (and I) realized that the infrastructure he had built was behaving incorrectly or needed more refining. At every juncture, Jack was the first to put his hand up and take the initiative on correcting (or, as the case may have been, correcting and augmenting) the matter at hand. During that process, there were times when we discovered that the script would have behaved as intended were it not for a careless syntactical error or a failure to check the correctness of the table at each intermediate step of its creation. Jack would do well to pay closer attention to detail in all matters data. Admittedly, when working with many thousands of lines of code, debugging a pesky issue can feel daunting and tiresome. This is all the more reason for Jack to ensure the correctness of his work piecewise, rather than spending hours building something whose error could have been discovered much earlier in the process of its construction.

Jack is clearly eager to advance his career, and I both understand and empathize with that desire deeply. Nonetheless, Jack’s interactions with his coworkers are the biggest areas in which I have noticed profound opportunity for improvement. In order to build himself up, Jack often belittles his coworkers (including me), mocking them, insinuating that their quality of work is not as high as his, or framing things in group conversations in such a way as to cast himself as the hero who has rescued his coworkers from ignorance and shotty craftsmanship. These comments, though probably intended to be funny, reveal a much deeper problem with how Jack sees himself relative to his coworkers. Competition is well and good, but collaboration and teamwork are arguably more important vehicles to elevate one’s own standing in any area of life, even more so in a team whose members collaborate so closely as ours.

Jack’s technical skills and interpersonal communication demand improvement, but he has clearly shown himself to be an eminently qualified, competent, and, as is most important, prolific member of our team. If monitored closely to ensure his worst qualities do not become his defining qualities, I have no doubt that he is both ready and deserving of the next step in his career with Key.


Rachel:

In all my travels, personal and professional, I have rarely met anyone as cordial, decent, and intelligent as Rachel Kreitzer.

When Rachel joined the bank in 2022, I speculated strongly to myself that she would prove to be the most, or equally most, impressive member of her CADP class. I now have the satisfaction of knowing that I was right in that speculation. I got the chance to work with Rachel extremely closely in 2024 during the branch closure project, when I was, functionally speaking, the project lead (while John Pole was on paternity leave) and she was the primary junior performer. Rachel’s ability to see important analytical findings readily from the underlying data, her tact at SQL, and, what is most impressive to me, her extremely skilled creation and curation of stakeholder presentation slide decks were on full display during the entirety of that project. It became obvious to me immediately that Rachel can, and should, be trusted to perform complex analytical investigations on her own. She prefers to work solo, meeting only rarely to discuss high-level matters and tactical direction. At the end of the day, when we discussed her findings, I never once found any of them to be anything but extraordinarily useful – indeed, they were all critical in defining where our investigations were going next, and which avenues she had explored would ultimately make it into each week’s stakeholder conversation.

It is completely obvious, and therefore I will not mince words discussing it, that Rachel feels strongly as though her career development at this company has been stunted by a perception of her personality and talents which she emphatically regards as inaccurate and ill-informed. Before working with her, I did not know whether I would come to agree with her on that supposition. I now do, and unequivocally so. Indeed, the thing which most delays people’s recognition of Rachel’s talents is Rachel’s own inability or unwillingness to advocate for herself and for the quality of her own work. I encouraged Rachel constantly during the branch closure project to speak up more in stakeholder updates, to lead conversations when appropriate, and to be fierce in the pursuit of advocating for herself. Though it was slow at first, I was glad to see Rachel’s responsiveness to this exhortation. At every juncture, when I was thanked or praised for the quality of my team’s findings, I was always quick to point out that Rachel had been the primary performer on most if not all of the matters which generated the praise.

Do not be deceived by Rachel’s quietness and politeness. These are marks chiefly of her humility and simple goodness. That from which Rachel will surely benefit the most is the cultivation of an environment wherein she feels empowered to speak, to speak freely, and to advocate on her own behalf. Her communication skills admittedly need to be refined, and she has the opportunities now on the KPB project to become a more confident primary presenter in stakeholder meetings. Her analytical skills are unquestioned, her technical competence is vast, and she has demonstrated unquestioned loyalty to this company by going above and beyond her normal job responsibilities to attend to logistical matters concerning the Arlington office. If we stand by Rachel, she will stand by us. And we would be remiss to dismiss Rachel’s shortcomings rather than to cultivate them. If we pursue the latter path, she will, without doubt, be known universally as one of the best and brightest that CAA has to offer.

Vikas:

When Vikas became the leader of CAA in April of this year, I had no intuition whatsoever as to what kind of a leader he would prove himself to be. I am now elated in the realization that Vikas has become, without a doubt, the best and most direct leader that CAA has had to date.

Vikas’s chief strengths lie in his directness, conciseness, and ability to distill complicated questions of analytics into clear and authoritative direction for his team members. Vikas has a no-nonsense approach to life and business, which is exactly the quality that the leader of our team most needs to possess. He keeps his direct reports and his second-degree reports in line each morning during our project standup meetings by making abundantly clear which avenues are worth pursuing and which will not generate sufficient value. In a team of analytical experts who are sometimes paralyzed by their own confidence in their ability to generate complex findings from less-than-ideal data, Vikas is our most trusted ally in our quest to do the right amount of work to solve the right problems.

There were musings on our team during 2024 that our leadership is not always attentive to our needs and concerns. I can only speak for myself and for my own perspective on this matter. I will state, genuinely, that I do not feel this way as it pertains to Vikas. Vikas has made me feel more welcome, and more included, than any past leader of our group. I know, as Vikas has made abundantly clear to me, that I am free to discuss whatever is on my mind, positive or negative, with Vikas at any time. I cannot state strongly enough what a breath of fresh air this sense of confidence and trust in my team’s leadership provides me. In tandem with this, I have never seen anyone so highly placed in the corporate organizational structure who is so willing to listen to performers well below his pay grade and status as Vikas. He is a trusted friend, an indispensable partner, and exactly what this team needs to be positioned for future success.

These remarks are short because I have little to say other than to extoll Vikas’s impressiveness, firm dedication to his teammates, and eminent qualification to continue to be the leader of CAA. With the clarity of instruction and passionate leadership he provides, there is no doubt in my mind that 2025 will prove to be an even more gratifying and prolific year for CAA and, by consequence, all of CAMS.

Self:
As I reflect on the past year, I am proud of the contributions I have made to our team and the organization as a whole. It has been a dynamic and rewarding year, filled with opportunities to lead, mentor, and innovate across several impactful projects. My focus throughout the year was not only on delivering results but also on building stronger collaborative relationships and fostering an environment of learning and excellence within our team.
Branch Closure Project
One of the highlights of my year was my role in the branch closure project, where I acted as the chief analytical lead. This project required a high level of precision, as it involved making data-driven decisions that would have lasting impacts on the organization. With our manager, John Pole, on paternity leave during a critical phase of the project, I stepped in to take on additional responsibilities, ensuring the team had the leadership and guidance needed to maintain momentum.
A key aspect of my role was mentoring Rachel, who was a newer team member at the time. This experience allowed me to share my expertise while helping her develop confidence and capability in her own analytical work. I took great care in fostering a supportive and collaborative dynamic, encouraging her to ask questions and think critically about the challenges we faced. Rachel’s growth throughout the project was a source of personal and professional satisfaction, as it reinforced the value of effective mentorship in achieving both individual and team success.
From an analytical perspective, I focused on developing clear, actionable insights to guide decision-making. I ensured our data models were robust, the findings were communicated effectively, and the leadership team had the tools they needed to make informed choices. The successful completion of this project underscored the importance of collaboration, adaptability, and a commitment to excellence, qualities I strove to demonstrate throughout.
KPC Project
Another major focus of my year was the KPC project, where I worked closely with Jack to deliver a Strategic Performance Report (SPR) that comprehensively tracked the performance of the KPC program from its inception in Q1 2023 to the present. This project required a deep understanding of the program’s objectives, as well as the ability to distill complex data into insights that could drive strategic decisions.
My primary responsibility was consulting on data matters, ensuring the SPR was not only accurate but also actionable. I worked diligently to identify key performance indicators that aligned with the program’s goals and designed the report to highlight trends, successes, and areas for improvement. My aim was to create a tool that stakeholders could rely on to measure progress and make informed adjustments to the program’s strategy.
This project allowed me to collaborate closely with Jack, combining our strengths to deliver a high-quality output. Through regular discussions and feedback sessions, we were able to refine the report to meet and exceed expectations. The final SPR was well-received, and I take pride in knowing that it will serve as a valuable resource for the organization in the years to come.
Additional Contributions
Beyond these major projects, I also had the opportunity to provide input and guidance on a range of data-related matters throughout the year. Whether it was troubleshooting data inconsistencies, developing streamlined workflows, or offering insights to support decision-making, I worked to ensure that our team’s analytical capabilities remained a strong asset to the organization. These smaller contributions, while less visible, were important in maintaining the overall quality and integrity of our work.
Strengths Demonstrated
This year, I had the opportunity to demonstrate several key strengths, including:
Leadership: Stepping up as the chief analytical lead during John Pole’s leave and providing mentorship to Rachel were opportunities to lead with confidence and purpose.
Analytical Excellence: From building the SPR for the KPC program to delivering actionable insights for the branch closure project, I consistently focused on producing high-quality, impactful work.
Collaboration and Communication: My ability to work closely with team members like Rachel and Jack, while maintaining open and effective communication with stakeholders, was a key factor in the success of our projects.
Opportunities for Growth
While I am proud of my achievements this year, I recognize there is always room for growth. One area I aim to focus on is refining my ability to juggle multiple high-stakes projects simultaneously, ensuring that each receives the attention and care it deserves. Additionally, I plan to explore new tools and techniques for advanced data visualization and analysis, which I believe could further enhance the value I bring to our team.
Looking Ahead
As I look to the future, I am excited about the opportunities ahead. My goal is to continue contributing to meaningful projects that align with the organization’s strategic priorities while fostering a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement within our team. I also plan to invest in my professional development by pursuing advanced training in data strategy and leadership, ensuring I remain well-equipped to meet the evolving demands of our work.
In summary, this year has been a period of growth and achievement for me. Through hard work, collaboration, and a commitment to excellence, I was able to make meaningful contributions to the branch closure and KPC projects, as well as the broader objectives of our organization. I look forward to building on these successes and embracing new challenges in the coming year.
